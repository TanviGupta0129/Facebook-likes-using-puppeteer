# Facebook-likes-using-puppeteer

I have made this project using node JS and puppeteer. 
This script automates Facebook and it likes any number of posts on Facebook.

Add Credentials file (Example: credential.json)
"user":"xxxxxxxx@gmail.com",
"pwd":"xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"url": "https://www.facebook.com"
